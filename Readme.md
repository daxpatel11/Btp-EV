## Finding an efficient strategy to solve the charging point placement problem .

#### Under professor *Dr. Samrat Mondal*

### Problem statement - 
Given a city map, including its specifications like charging demand, candidate locations and grid network, find a charging point placement strategy (not necessarily optimal, NP-Hard) which can satisfy the charging demand of these candidate locations.


### Proposed solution - 
Near optimal greedy algo for placing charging points to optimize a multi-objective involving costs like: Charging point installation cost, travel penalty and grid penalty.
