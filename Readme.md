## Placing EV (electric vehicle) charging points in smart cities of future India.  

#### Under professor *Dr. Samrat Mondal*

### Problem statement - 
Given a city map, including its specifications (like heat map,
population density, candidate locations etc), find a charging point
placement strategy (not necessarily optimal, NP-Hard) which can
satisfy the charging demand of these candidate locations.

### Proposed solution - 
Near optimal algo for setting up min no. of charging stations which satisfy the charging needs of a city using a greedy strategy.
